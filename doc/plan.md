# **Project Plan: BekasBerkah E-commerce Template**

**Version 1.0 | Based on PRD v3.0**

## **Overview**
This plan outlines the development roadmap for the BekasBerkah e-commerce template, a functional demo application for buying and selling second-hand goods. The project follows a phased approach, starting with admin modules and progressing to user-facing features.

## **Development Phases**

### **Phase 1: Admin Module Development**
**Goal:** Build a comprehensive admin dashboard for product and order management.

**Key Features:**
- Admin Dashboard (main page with overview)
- Product Management (CRUD operations)
- Category Management
- Submission Management (for seller applications)
- Order Management (processing incoming orders)

**Tech Stack Setup:**
- Next.js with TypeScript
- Dexie.js for local IndexedDB storage
- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui for UI
- Initial project structure and dependencies

### **Phase 2: User Storefront Development**
**Goal:** Create the public-facing storefront that displays admin-managed data.

**Key Features:**
- Product Gallery & Detail Pages
- Search & Filter Functionality
- Shopping Cart & Checkout Process
- Seller Submission Form
- User Account Page (transaction history simulation)

## **Branch Strategy**
Each major feature will be developed in its own branch:
- `feature/admin-dashboard`
- `feature/product-management`
- `feature/category-management`
- `feature/submission-management`
- `feature/order-management`
- `feature/product-gallery`
- `feature/search-filter`
- `feature/cart-checkout`
- `feature/seller-form`
- `feature/user-account`

## **Implementation Guidelines**
- Use SOLID principles for code structure
- Initialize Shadcn/ui components using `bunx shadcn@latest add <component-name>`
- Always use `bun` for package management
- Ensure responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Mock data for demonstration purposes
- Client-side simulation for all interactions

## **Testing & Validation**
- Functional testing for all user journeys
- UI/UX validation for responsiveness
- Code quality checks
- Demo readiness verification

## **Deployment**
- Deploy to Vercel for public demo access
- Ensure all features work in browser environment
- Prepare README with setup and demo instructions
