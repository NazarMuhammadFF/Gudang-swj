### 🔧 Issues Found & Fixed

#### Issue #1: Admin Profile vs User Profile Separation

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Fix Applied:**

- Updated NavUserButton to show "Admin Panel" for admin only
- Admin can't access /account (redirects to /admin)
- User can't see admin button
- Admin sidebar shows "Mode Administrator" info instead of personal profile

#### Issue #2: Missing Loading States

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED
**Description:** Need to verify all async operations have loading indicators
**Finding:** All critical async operations already have loading states

- Login: `isLoading` state with spinner
- Checkout: Loading during order creation
- Forms: Disabled buttons during submission
- Data fetching: Loading skeletons

#### Issue #3: Database Backward Compatibility

**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Description:** New Order schema broke seed data
**Fix Applied:**

- Made new fields optional in Order interface
- Added fallback: `order.totalAmount || order.total || 0`
- Seed data works with legacy format

### ⚠️ Minor Issues to Track

#### Issue #A: Product Image 404

**Priority:** Low
**Description:** Placeholder images may 404 if URL invalid
**Recommendation:** Add image error handling with fallback
**Status:** Deferred (demo app acceptable)

#### Issue #B: Mobile Menu

**Priority:** Low
**Description:** No hamburger menu for mobile navigation
**Recommendation:** Add mobile drawer menu for better UX
**Status:** Deferred (current responsive design acceptable)

#### Issue #C: Form Field Help Text

**Priority:** Low
**Description:** Some forms could use more helper text
**Recommendation:** Add hints for price format, image URLs, etc.
**Status:** Deferred (validation messages sufficient)
